Before starting we need to understand some of the terminology.

A - Mutability refers to whether an object's value can be changed after creation. And List allows this.

A - we know data structures are used to store multiple values so duplicates means same value occuring
multiple time. List allows this.

A - List maintains ordered data structure maintains the sequence of elements as they were inserted. This
means you can access elements using their position (index).

A - List have heterogenous nature that means we can have multiple data types inside the list.

# fruits = ["Apple","Banana","Pineapple","Mango","Pomegranate"]

# for i in fruits:
#     print(i)

# fruits[1] = "Grapes"
# print(" \n added grapes in the list \n")
# for i in fruits:
#     print(i)

# print(" \n sorted the list \n")
# fruits.sort()
# for i in fruits:
#     print(i)
